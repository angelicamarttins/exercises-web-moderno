In this repository, is stored some code from the course [Web Moderno](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-web/) taught by [Cod3r](https://www.cod3r.com.br/) in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). At the end of some sections, we have exercises and challenges to do and you can find my solutions for them here. 

My main objective is to train my logical thought and test some JavaScript's functions e methods learned throughout the course.
